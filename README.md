# Voting-System
This code is a console-based voting system written in Python. It includes features for logging in as an admin or user and options for adding, removing, and viewing candidate lists and total votes. 
The data is saved and loaded from a CSV file using the csv module. The termcolor module is used for colored terminal output. 
The collections module is used for creating the candidate_votes dictionary. 
The program starts by checking if the voters.txt file exists, if so, it loads the data into the corresponding variables, otherwise, it creates empty lists and dictionaries.
